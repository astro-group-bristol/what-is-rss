#slide(title: "The advantages")[

  You get more time to do other things.
  - Feeds have an end again.
  - Everything in one place.

  #v(1em)

  Publishing RSS is easy!
  - Your favourite blogs (probably) have RSS feeds.
  - Journals and ArXiV publish RSS.
  - YouTube channels can be treated as RSS feeds.

#slide(title: "How to get started?")[
  #set text(size: 22pt)
  You'll need a *feed reader* and an RSS feed you want to fetch from.

  Some recommendations:
  - #link("https://www.inoreader.com/")[Inoreader]
  - #link("https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader")[Fluent Reader (GitHub)]
  - #link("https://newsboat.org/")[Newsboat]
  - #link("https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard")[RSS Guard (GitHub)]

  There are plugins for other apps as well, such as web browsers or Obsidian.

  A good list of people's #link("https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/16yo2p5/your_favorite_rss_reader/")[favourite readers (Reddit)], but caution, not all of them are FOSS.

  A _huge_ list of RSS feeds to look through: \ #link("https://github.com/plenaryapp/awesome-rss-feeds")
]

#slide(title: "How can I make my own?")[
  Write a generator yourself (it's quite straight forward)!

  Use a package that will generate it for you:
  - e.g., for Python there is the #link("https://github.com/svpino/rfeed")[rfeed] package.

  Share it with your friends! Build your own syndication network!
]

#slide(title: "Tips")[
  #set text(size: 30pt)
  - Don't subscribe to too many feeds. Only keep the ones that continue to post things you find interesting.
  - Avoid feeds that only contain a link to a webpage.
  - Don't refresh your feed too often.

  Have fun! üéâ
